### 🚀 About Me

I am a Materials Science undergraduate at Zhejiang University, currently on an aggressive and passionate journey to pivot into the world of Computer Science. My fascination isn't just with what computers can do, but **how** they do it.

* 🧠 I'm driven by a deep curiosity for the foundational principles of computer systems—from hardware architecture and OS kernels to compiler optimizations.
* 👨‍💻 My recent journey has been a deep dive into High-Performance Computing, where I've built a solid foundation in parallel programming using **CUDA, OpenMP, and MPI**.
* 💡 I believe that a profound understanding of the underlying layers is the key to building truly efficient and powerful software. My goal is to bridge the gap between abstract algorithms and their physical execution on hardware.
