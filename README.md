## 🚀 About Me

I am currently an undergraduate student in Computer Science at Zhejiang University.  
My early training focused on **systems and high-performance computing**, which gave me a solid understanding of low-level computation, parallelism, and system efficiency.

As I explored research problems that involve real-world data and modeling, my interests gradually shifted toward **AI-driven modeling approaches**, especially for data with **temporal dynamics and structured relationships**, such as **time series and spatio-temporal systems**.

I am currently participating in research activities in the **AINet group**, where I focus on **time series modeling, spatio-temporal data analysis, and their applications in real-world systems**.
